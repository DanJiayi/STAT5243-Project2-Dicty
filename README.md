### Mini Project 2: Where Will Dicty Meet?

This project aims to predict the future aggregation location(s) of Dicty using only the early portion of each movie. 

The code present a comprehensive evaluation of different spatiotemporal prediction models, examine their key components through ablation studies, evaluate their robustness, perform a variety of visualization analyses, and further introduce and refined a VAE-based framework to account for uncertainty in future-frame prediction.
