### Mini Project 2: Where Will Dicty Meet?

This project aims to predict the future aggregation location(s) of Dicty using only the early portion of each movie. To accomplish this task, we need to address the following two challenging problems:

The code present a comprehensive evaluation of different spatiotemporal prediction models, examine their key components through ablation studies, evaluate their robustness, perform a variety of visualization analyses, and further introduce and refined a VAE-based framework to account for uncertainty in future-frame prediction.
